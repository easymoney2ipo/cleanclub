# Getting Started with Create React App

This is main skeleton for starting new project.  We use MUI ( Material UI + Tailwind), [integrtion_doc](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#tailwind-css)

## Getting started

You should clone project then run
### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


* We put some basic stuff in tailwind.config.js all this 'extend:' part is to have some style colors, stuff for later use...
